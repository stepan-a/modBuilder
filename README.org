* modBuilder class
#+html:</div>


=modBuilder= is a MATLAB class aimed at simplifying the interactive and
programmatic creation of Dynare =.mod= files. It allows users to
incrementally define the core components of a macroeconomic model --
parameters, endogenous and exogenous variables, and equations—directly
from the MATLAB environment. The class supports dynamic declaration
and reclassification of symbols. Each endogenous variable is
associated with a unique equation, and the class maintains a symbol
table that tracks the presence and usage of every parameter or
variable across equations. This facilitates consistency checks, error
detection, and modular model development. Users can modify or replace
equations at any stage, and any unused symbols are automatically
cleaned up. The model can be exported to a fully formatted Dynare .mod
file, ready for simulation or estimation. The design encourages a
structured yet flexible workflow, enabling model manipulation through
intuitive methods and MATLAB’s language. With support
for deep copies, serialisation, and custom indexing, =modBuilder=
integrates smoothly into 
version-controlled projects. Its implementation ensures that the
generated =.mod= files are syntactically valid and semantically
consistent, reducing manual effort and error risk.
